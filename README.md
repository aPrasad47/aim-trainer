# My Personal Project

## Task 2, Description
For my personal project, I plan on creating a basic aim training application. If a user were to run this application,
the first thing that will show up is a menu screen with various game modes to choose from (I am not entirely sure what
these game modes will be yet, but possibly one continuous mode, and one timed mode, or others). Once a game mode is
chosen, the user will spawn into a 2D interface that, once a key is pressed or a mouse click occurs, will begin
generating targets, but there will be a grace period to get ready. The targets will only show up for a few seconds before the user misses their opportunity to hit
them. There will be a timer at the top, an accuracy indicator, and possibly a lives tracker (for a more challenging
game mode). As well, there may be a lifetime statistics tracker. The application is targeted towards users who play
video games with a mouse and keyboard input (although I may try adding controller support on my own after the term).
I am interested in this project because I play video games on PC, and the video games that I play are mostly FPS games.
Typically, I use a controller as my input device, but I want to switch to mouse and keyboard full-time. So, this
application would help me, as well as others who either want to switch to mouse and keyboard or want to practice their
aim, in transitioning.

## Task 3, User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add a target that has been to a list of hit targets
- As a user, I want to be able to add a target that has not been hit a list of non-hit targets
- As a user, I want to be able to add a list of the rounds I have played to a class that analyzes the data and produces statistics
- As a user, I want to be able to select a previously saved aim training session and view all of its corresponding
  statistics
- As a user, I want to be able to select moving targets to shoot or stationary targets to shoot
- As a user, I want to be able to select a previous aim training session that has been automatically saved (the user
  can manually save the aim training sessions that they want to keep for however long, but the automatically saved aim
  training sessions disappear after more aim training sessions have been logged) and view all of its corresponding
  statistics
- As a user, I want to be able to select multiple previously automatically / manually saved aim training sessions
  and compare all of their statistics with each other
- As a user, I want to be able to change the color of the targets
- As a user, I want to be able to change the size of the targets
- As a user, I want to be able to change the speed of the targets (if the moving targets option is chosen)
- As a user, I want to be able to view a graph of my individual session statistics and a graph of my lifetime statistics
